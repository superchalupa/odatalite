# the purpose of this script is to set up the project to build on an initial
# source control checkout.  we don't check generated files into source control,
# so you need to run autoreconf to set up the configure script. Since configure
# is generally run next, this script runs a default configure. Pass in any
# options to this script that you want passed to configure if you want
# non-default options.
#
# if you specifically want to configure for a 32 bit build on a 64-bit system,
# use the conf32 script as a guide.
