All commands below are assumed to be run from the top of the source tree unless otherwise specified

$ PHIT_PREFIX=$PWD/runtime ./out/phitd -i -S -l VERBOSE


TODO:
    - modified PHIT_HeadersFind to change all non-alnum in search string to "_" to support cgi. Need to do the same in PHIT when parsing headers.
    - Ask Mike Brasher about buf.h.new
    - Ask about using connection buf in odataplugin, why not context?


Some old scripts/ were removed as unneeded anymore:
# autoclean - not needed: run "make distclean" and everything should be cleaned up
# rebuild - just run make. everything that needs to be rebuilt will always be
#           rebuilt, even if you edit makefiles or configure.ac
# prependlicense - looks like it's not necessary anymore since everything has
#                  licenses
# fixup - Not needed, git has the proper permissions for everything
